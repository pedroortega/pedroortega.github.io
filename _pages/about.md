## Pedro A. Ortega
AGI and Cybernetics Researcher

## About

I was VP of research at **Kosen Labs** and prior to that, lead of the **Safety Analysis Team at DeepMind**. My research focuses on **artificial general intelligence** and the **formal principles of intelligence**, covering aspects such as learning, planning and decision making in both machines and biological organisms. My approach lies at the intersection between machine learning, computational neuroscience, theoretical economics, and physics.

## Research Interests

{{ :free-energy.png?300|Free Energy Functional (it's also meant to be a puzzling pic)}}
 
Most of my work centers on information-theoretic and statistical mechanical approaches to learning and control, leading to contributions in bounded rationality models and recasting adaptive control as a causal inference problem. I have also worked on causal induction, and on game- and decision-theoretic models in computational neuroscience. 

To get a sense of my work, please refer to:
  * my {{:papers:thesis.pdf|PhD thesis}} on bounded rationality and Bayesian control,
  * my paper on {{:papers:minimumrelentropylearningacting.pdf|Thompson sampling}} as Bayesian causal inference,
  * my paper on [bounded rationality](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/469/2153/20120683) through thermodynamic principles,
  * or my [publications](/publications).

I was part of the former **Tuebingen group on Sensorimotor Learning and Decision Making**, where some of the now widespread ideas on Thompson sampling, causality, and thermodynamic methods for reinforcement learning have originated.
